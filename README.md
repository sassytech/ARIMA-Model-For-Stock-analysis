# ARIMA-Model-For-Stock-analysis
 An autoregressive integrated moving average, or ARIMA, is a statistical analysis model that uses time series data to either better understand the data set or to predict future trends. 
A statistical model is autoregressive if it predicts future values based on past values. For example, an ARIMA model might seek to predict a stock's future prices based on its past performance or forecast a company's earnings based on past periods. 
An ARIMA model can be understood by outlining each of its components as follows:
•	Autoregression (AR): refers to a model that shows a changing variable that regresses on its own lagged, or prior, values.
•	Integrated (I): represents the differencing of raw observations to allow for the time series to become stationary (i.e., data values are replaced by the difference between the data values and the previous values).
•	Moving average (MA):  incorporates the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.
           ARIMA Parameters
               The parameters can be defined as:
•	p: the number of lag observations in the model; also known as the lag order.
•	d: the number of times that the raw observations are differenced; also known as the degree of differencing.
•	q: the size of the moving average window; also known as the order of the moving average.
